# What is a  Mini App?

A MiniApp as a Smart Widgets are interactive graphical components encapsulated as Nostr events, designed for seamless integration into applications. Each widget type serves a specific purpose, with well-defined structures and behaviors to support various use cases.

### Action Widget

- **Description:** A streamlined widget designed to trigger an action by embedding a URL in an iframe.
- **Components:**
    - Image (single, for visual representation).
    - Button (single, type: app).
- **Behavior:**
    - Clicking the button opens the specified URL within an iframe.
    - The iframe does not return any data to the parent application.
- **Use Case:** Suitable for launching external applications or resources without expecting a response, such as opening a third-party tool.

### Tool Widget

- **Description:** A widget that facilitates interaction with an external application via an iframe, with data exchange capabilities.
- **Components:**
    - Image (single, for visual representation).
    - Button (single, type: app).
- **Behavior:**
    - Clicking the button opens the specified URL within an iframe.
    - The iframe is configured to return data to the parent application upon interaction.

## Technical Notes

- **Nostr Event Structure:** Each widget is represented as a Nostr event, ensuring compatibility with the Nostr protocol for decentralized communication.
- **Iframe Integration:** For Action and Tool widgets, the iframe must adhere to standard web security practices (e.g., sandboxing, CORS policies) to ensure safe URL embedding.
- **Extensibility:** Developers can customize widget appearance and behavior within the defined constraints (e.g., maximum button limits, single input field) to align with application requirements.
